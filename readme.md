## How to Run the Server
1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (version 14+ recommended)
2. Clone this repository
3. Install dependencies:
   ```npm install```
4. Start the server:
   ```npm start```
5. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:2000` (I used 2000 because I somehow broke 3000. Or maybe 3000 is mad at me for abusing it and it'll forgive me later)

```npm run dev```
